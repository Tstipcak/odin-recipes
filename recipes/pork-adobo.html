            <h3>Tasty Details</h3>
                <p>This dish is one of my favorite dishes to make.  It has minimal prep and great flavors. My favorite time to make it is on a Sunday night.  That way I have plenty of leftovers for Monday at lunch.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
               <ul>
                   <li>3 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>

                   <li>1/4 of a cup of white vinegar</li>
                   <li>1/3 of a cup of soy sauce</li>
