        <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My fiance loves when I make this dish. Well she just loves when I make tacos in general. This is probably her favorite though! We got this recipe, as well as many others, from Danny Trejo's cookbook. Enjoy with the side of your choice</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 tortillas</li>
                <li>1 pound of peeled U15 Shrimp</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of chipotle chilis in adobo sauce</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of cumin</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of chili powder</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons of garlic powder</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of cilantro (for topping)</li>
                <li>1 lime (for topping)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of pickled red onion (for topping) </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl mix the shrimp with the adobo sauce,cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  If you want extra spice, add in a chopped chipotle pepper</li>
                <li>Heat a cast iron pan with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium high heat </li>
                <li>Place the shrimp in the hot pan and cook about 3 minutes per side.  The sauce will start to carmelize turning a dark brown color </li>
                <li>While the shrimp is cooking, heat the tortillas in the microwave for 15-20 seconds</li>
                <li>Add the cooked shrimp to the tortilla.  Add your toppings of choice. <i>(My fiance loves to add cojita cheese as well)</i></li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
